# Movie & TV Show Search Application

This is a simple web application to search for movies and TV shows.
It allows users to find details like title, rating, and overview.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Data is fetched from an external movie API.
The UI is clean and easy to use.
This project helped me understand API integration.
It also improved my frontend development skills.
The application runs directly in the browser.
This project is for learning and practice purposes.
